        The Bloomsbury Set

      <div class="bloomsbury-shop__content-copy">
        Inspired by the free spirited artists
        of the Bloomsbury set,
        a collection of scents capturing
        the intoxicating essence
        of an unconventional life
        in their legendary country house in Sussex.
        <br />
        The lily pond at dawn, bold blue hyacinth,
        absinthe afternoons and golden linseed
        on paint-stained hands.
        Warming whisky and sweet pipe tobacco.
        The secrets of waxed floors
        burnished by footsteps in the night.
